## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to include the necessary jQuery Mobile files in your HTML file. You can do this by adding the following links to your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.css" />
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.4.5/jquery.mobile-1.4.5.min.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can download the files from the [jQuery Mobile website](https://jquerymobile.com/download/) and include them in your project manually.

## Usage

Once you've included the necessary files, you can start building your mobile application using the components provided by jQuery Mobile. Refer to the [jQuery Mobile documentation](https://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/) for information on available components and how to use them.
